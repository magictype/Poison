Just a bit more than perfection.
There is nothing good or bad in itself. It's only the amount in which it has been served makes it so. I will poison you the moment I start growing in you, more than you. Everything that I have cured in you is going to rule you in return. As Poison.


Poison is a Latin display typeface, belongs to the genre of beauty that is obsessed by the glamour and fame at the cost of being toxic.
